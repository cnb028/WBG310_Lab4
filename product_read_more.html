                        <p>
                            This board game is for up to 4 players, and can be pretty long depending on the style of play and the players themselves. The game has 4 types of players:<br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Farmer</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Fisher</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Forager</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>Miner</p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The different styles of players allows for different strengths and weaknesses. They also allow for various styles of teaming up. The Miner can get the ores to upgrade the Farmer
                            and the forager. Once they are upgrades, the Forager buys the seeds and the Farmer can water the seeds. If the Forager is buying the seeds, this allows for multiple seeds to be stacked
                            ontop of one another creating a higher increase of crop income. The Farmer watering the seeds after being upgraded allows for faster harvests. The fisher can help by creating more income
                            but also getting more things you can give as presents to the villagers to make friends.

                        <p>I feel the video below explains the game enough. This is a very fun party game that pits you against your friends as you try to out drink, our gamble, and over all try to be the last person standing.</p>
