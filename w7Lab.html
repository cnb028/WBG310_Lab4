                        <p>Inspired by Earthbound, Undertale is a multi-storyline game that has multiple storylines based on the choices you make. The game has a lot of humorous moments alongside
                        some moments that either cause you to really think, or can be horrific if too much thought is put into it. Some choices can also carry over to the next playthrough. </p>
                        <p>Undertale is a 2D pixelated game that has really simple controls but can be difficult due to the style of combat. While the game can seem endless due to the multi-storyline design,
                            in truth, this does not read as a non-ending game. The gameplay gets tiresome after awhile and the jokes get old.</p>
